Elephpant progress bar plugin
---

The plugin replaces PhpStorm's progress bar with an adorable PHP mascot.

<a href="https://www.php.net/elephpant.php">Elephpant logo</a> is created by Vincent Pontier.

This plugin is entirely based on the <a href="https://github.com/dlsniper/gopher">Gopher plugin</a> by
Florin Pățan. And inherits <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8575-nyan-progress-bar">Nyan Progress Bar plugin</a> from Dmitry Batkovich.
